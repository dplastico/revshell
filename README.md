# revshell
revshell is a custom script that prints in prompt a lot of different reverse shells options with a given IP and PORT to copy and paste 
Currently supports:
- Linux Reverse Shells

- PHP one liner reverse shell

# USAGE

usage is quite simple, just run:

There's a major designt change now, so I will update the video soon ^^

You can also copy or create a simbolic link to your "bin" folder to execute it from any prompt 

$ cp revshell.py /usr/local/bin/revshell

	OR

$ cp revshell.py /usr/bin/revshell
